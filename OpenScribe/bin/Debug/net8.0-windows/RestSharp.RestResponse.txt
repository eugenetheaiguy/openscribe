She is currently maintained on Vyvanse 30 mg daily, which works in the morning; however, she feels the effects wear off in the afternoon. She is also taking Wellbutrin 100 mg PO BID without any negative effects.

Megan presents as a young lady who was pleasant and cooperative during the assessment. Speech was spontaneous and coherent. Mood was subjectively good. Objectively, she appeared mildly anxious. Thought form was normal. Thought content showed symptoms consistent with ADHD, inattentive type, and generalized anxiety disorder.
